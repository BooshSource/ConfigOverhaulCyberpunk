## Config Overhaul for Cyberpunk 2077

This tool allows to configure hidden settings in Cyberpunk 2077. You can squeeze more FPS out of it this way.
It works by generating configration files, and will not modify the game executable. So new Patches will still work with this Tool.
You can pick out of 4 Presets, or just play around yourself with your own custom settings.

### Presets were made with an AMD RADEON RX480 GPU
#### Note: Disabling Async compute will only increase FPS on older Graphics cards. (All Pre-RTX 20xx Series GPUs, All Pre-Vega Radeon GPUs with the exception of the RX590) On newer cards, it will lower the FPS.

* Disable Async compute  ~  2-5 fps more
* Optimized Preset       ~  5-10 fps more
* Low                    ~ 10-20 fps more
* Very Low               ~ 14-24 fps more

I recomend to try out the Low preset first.
My base framerate was ~45 fps, but with the "low" preset i get now 60 fps without any major quality lose. (Played on almost low anyway before.)
Use the Very Low preset only when you really need, because it makes the game ugly.

#### How to install?
Copy the executable into your root Cyberpunk 2077 folder.
* Steam Example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Cyberpunk 2077\
* GOG Galaxy Example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\Games\Cyberpunk 2077\

I also recommend to use the "PerformanceOverhaulCyberpunk Mod" in combination with this tool to reach max performance.
